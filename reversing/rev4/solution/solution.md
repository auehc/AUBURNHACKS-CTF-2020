We are given a java class file. We can start a few ways, choosing dynamic analysis right off the bat or going the static approach.

Static is the best bet as it's best to get some background information first. 
Using a tool called **jd-gui** we can decompile the java class file.

We essentially get the source code, minus comments. 
Looking at the source code we can see there is an encrypt function that takes in a parameter and checks it against a hard coded int array. 
The parameter is takes is a string that is generated by the user.
One could bruteforce this and see if it works... or just go to your favorite online XOR encoder and throw in `{ 0x03, 0x19, 0x03, 0x07, 0x0e, 0x0a, 0x10, 0x1b }` against the key `aubie`.

Once you do that you should get the result `blankkey`. 
Running the program and entering that as your input will give you the flag!
