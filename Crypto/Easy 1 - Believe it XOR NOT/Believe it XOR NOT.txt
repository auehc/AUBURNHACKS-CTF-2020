Description:
    nc [ip_addr] [port]
    
    On remote host:
        You intercepted a 'secret' key used to encrypt the following message.
        What did the sender of the encrypted message say?
        
        Ciphertext:
        [ciphertext]
        Message:
        [user_input]
    
Solution:
    The ciphertext is created using the following formula:
        1. Each character is converted to it's binary equivalent
        2. Each bit within the characters binary equivalent is flipped. i.e, 0->1 and 1->0.
        3. The flipped chunk is then XORed with a given value
        4. Each chunk is then converted to its ASCII equivalent
        
    The plaintext is created using the following formula:
        1. Each character of the ciphertext is converted to binary
        2. Each binary chunk is XORed with a given value.
        3. Every bit of the XORed chunk is flipped
        4. Every chunk is converted to its ASCII equivalent.
